Please no, I can't be fired - I'm fired!Um...um...Clayton. Clara Clayton. (Marty quickly pulls out the photo of the tombstone and looks at it. He looks from the photo to Doc and Clara.) Clara. What a beautiful name. (Later) (The three of them are riding towards Clara's cabin near the school. Marty is pulling along a single horse that carries Clara's things. Doc and Marty unload the stuff onto her porch.)(Tannen tightens the noose around Marty's neck and they hoist him up so that he is hanging from the rope with his feet dangling. Tannen and his gang are enjoying this. From a short distance away a man steps into view. We only see that he is wearing boots and a long coat. He holds a long gun in his hand. Neither the gang or Marty have seen him yet.) Haven't had a hanging in a long time! (The man points the gun and fires. He severs the rope that is holding Marty up and Marty falls to the ground taking a very deep breath. The gang looks at the man for the first time and raise their guns.) It'll shoot the fleas off a dogs back at 500 yards, Tannen, and its pointed straight at your head!! (Tannen motions to his gang and they all lower their guns.)</b>

His radiation hood is over his face, and they think he's an alien.) Ahh. Children. (they high tale it out of the barn.) Listen, woah. (he trips but gets back up.) Hello, uh excuse me. Sorry about your barn. (Marty opens the barn door.)It's 300 bucks Terry! If I catch the guy who caused this, I'll break his neck! (Marty gets into the back of the car unseen and covers himself with a sheet. Cut to 2015 Biff as 1955 Biff and Terry enter the Western Auto Stores shop.) The manure! I remember that! (As 2015 Biff walks off, 1955 Biff and Terry come out of the store. Biff pushes past a kid on a scooter. Terry is holding 4 cans. They're in the middle of their conversation.) ...4 cans of Valvoline.(w.t) That means Jennifer's OK and Einie's OK, right? (DeLorean) (w.t) That's right Marty! It's the ripple effect, the future is back. Now let's go home! (Street) (w.t) Right Doc, let's get our asses back to the future... (Lightning strikes, bringing down a tree.) Doc, Doc, are you OK?</b>
